## Experience
### **Software Developer Intern @ [Voya Investment Management](https://investments.voya.com/)**
- Designed and implemented no-code modules for data loading, schema validation, exception handling, structured logging, and canonical formatting within a centralized Python-based integration framework, enabling non-technical stakeholders to onboard datasets, supporting the ingestion of ~50 pilot datasets, and increasing successful onboarding rates by 20%.
- Collaborated with data engineering and DevOps teams to modularize components, streamline test-to-production deployments, and reduce promotion time.
- Authored unit and integration tests, defined API contracts, and leveraged AI-assisted development tools (GitHub Copilot) for rapid prototyping and documentation generation, accelerating development cycles.
- Gained exposure to financial transaction and regulatory data workflows spanning equities, fixed income, ETFs, and derivatives (Bloomberg/Refinitiv feeds), including trade execution, settlement, reconciliations, KYC/AML, and compliance reporting; strengthened understanding of how ETL pipelines, exception handling, and audit logging support data controls in an enterprise investment platform.

## Extracurricular
